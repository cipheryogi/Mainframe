      screen. The DSNAME would be as follows:

  *** XPEDITOR ---> Use of test scripts                                        
                                                                               
    Objective - In order to execute some of the actions                        
                like forcing data to certain program variables,                
                setting up breakpoints or interrupts. These actions            
                need not be performed everytime U go into XPEDITOR.            
                You take the help of a test script to perform these            
                frequent actions.                                              
                                                                               
    First of all you will have to include your test script library             
    in the INCLUDE option of the SETUP MENU . Now you will have to             
    create a test script member that would reside in this test script          
    library. The easiest way to go about creating this script is to            
    initially run the program in XPEDITOR and execute it to test the           
    logic of the program. Just when you quit the session after the             
    first cycle of execution you would reach a screen which informs            
    you about the creation of a log and a script. You can get into             
    the SCRIPT and edit it so as to satisfy your requirements                  
    and save it in your TEST SCRIPT library. The next time you run             
    the program in XPEDITOR all you have to do is to type                      
    INCLUDE MEMBERNAME on the command line at the time of execution.           
       
    in the INCLUDE option of the SETUP MENU . Now you will have to             
    create a test script member that would reside in this test script          
    library. The easiest way to go about creating this script is to            
    initially run the program in XPEDITOR and execute it to test the
