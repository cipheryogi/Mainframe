XPEDITER Commands
 
Some commonly used XPEDITER/CICS primary commands are:
 
AFTER     
Sets conditional or unconditional breakpoints after the execution of a
statement or instruction.                                            
 
BEFORE    
Sets conditional or unconditional breakpoints before the execution of a
statement or instruction.                                             
 
CALC      
Performs hexadecimal/decimal calculations and displays the results online.
 
COUNT     
Sets execution counts and gathers test coverage statistics.
 
DELETE    
Removes either a specific object or a dataset record, depending on the
screen you access.                                                   
 
EXCLUDE   
Excludes specified lines from display. You see only the lines of code in which you are interested. When you step through a program, lines are redisplayed as they are executed so you can see the logic flow of the program. Symbolic label support is provided so that you can exclude a range of lines.                                                         
 
EXIT (PF4)
Transfers to the Exit Session screen.
 
FIND      
Positions the cursor on a specified string. Can be used in conjunction with the EXCLUDE command.                                            
 
GO (PF12) 
Executes program logic by the specified parameter. If no parameters are specified, resumes execution from the current location. GO 5 1 will execute five statements, pausing one second between each statement. GO UNTIL WA-HOURS executes until the value of WA-HOURS changes.          
 
GOTO        
Used to reposition execution at another point in the program. Repositions the current execution pointer to the specified statement, offset, or address.                                                                 
 
GPREGS      
Sets footing options to the general purpose registers.
 
HELP (PF1)  
Displays hypertext online help. HELP COMMANDS displays a list of the available commands. HELP NEWS gives information about the current release. Entering HELP on a particular screen will display information about that screen.                                                                   
 
KEEP        
Selects the contents of a data item to be viewed in the scrollable and sizeable keep window. To change displayed data, overtype it with a new value.                                                                
 
LOCATE * (PF6)
Transfers from any XPEDITER screen directly to the Source Listing screen (2.L) or Assembler Break/Abend screen (2.20).                           
 
REPEAT        
Re-executes the last primary command.
 
SET           
Changes debugging parameters:                                              
      KEEPS: Changes the size of the keep window.                             
            JUSTIFICATION: Clips the current source listing so that extraneous data 
      in the source is removed from the display. SET JUSTIFICATION ON clips   
      the lines and suppresses all lines before the first and after the last  
      source line in the display.                                              
      SOURCE: Provides either a source or break/abend focus.                  
      FOOT: Changes the data displayed in the FOOTING.                        
      DATA: Displays hex result of last CALC command.                        
      KEYS: Displays the PF key settings.                                   
            REGS: Displays current program register contents, assembler instruction, and PSW
      for break/abend.                     
      SOURCE: Displays five lines of source.                     
      STATUS: Displays status of current task.                  
 
SHOW

SKIP     
Temporarily bypasses the execution of a statement.
    
USING         
Maps data according to a record format from a COBOL program in the file utility.                                                              
 
VERIFY        
Displays and, if desired, modifies Assembler object code.
WHEN          
Sets conditions for pausing program execution.
