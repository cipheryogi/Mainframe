IKJEFT01, IKJEFT1A and IKJEFT1B
 
The difference between IKJEFT01 and IKJEFT1B is that one will provide appropriate return codes to your job, and the other one will "mask" failures and return a return code of 0000 even if your request failed. IKJEFT01 masks the return code.
PGM=IKJEFT01
When a command completes with a non-zero return code, the program goes to the next command. When a command abends, the step ends with a condition code of 12 (X'C').  
PGM=IKJEFT1A
If a command or program being processed by IKJEFT1A ends with a system abend, IKJEFT1A causes the job step to terminate with a X'04C' system completion code. IKJEFT1A also returns to the caller the completion code from the command or program in register 15. If a command or program being processed by IKJEFT1A ends with a user abend, IKJEFT1A saves the completion code in register 15 and then terminates.If a command, program or REXX exec being processed by IKJEFT1A returns a non-zero return code to IKJEFT1A, IKJEFT1A saves this return code in register 15 and then terminates. Non-zero return codes to IKJEFT1A from CLISTs will not affect the contents of register 15 and the TMP will continue processing. For a non-zero return code or an abend from a command or program that was not given control directly by IKJEFT1A, no return code is saved in register 15, and IKJEFT1A does not terminate.
PGM=IKJEFT1B
If a command or program being processed by IKJEFT1B ends with a system or user abend, IKJEFT1B causes the job step to terminate with a X'04C' system completion code. IKJEFT1B also returns to the caller the completion code from the command or program in register 15. If a command, program, CLIST, or REXX exec being processed by IKJEFT1B returns a non-zero return code to IKJEFT1B, IKJEFT1B saves this return code in register 15 and then terminates. For a non-zero return code or abend completion code from a program or command that was not given control by IKJEFT1B, no return code is saved in register 15, and IKJEFT1B does not terminate.
