Copying VSAM dataset into PS dataset
 
Copying VSAM dataset into PS dataset
Use the regular file copy option in FILE-AID i.e. 3.3 on the indexed file
In FILE-AID panel - write the output dataset name with DISPOSITION=OLD and select ‘B’ (BATCH) mode and hit enter
You will get a message - ER852-OUTPUT DATASET NOT AVAILABLE, TAPE ASSUMED. Ignore this message and type JCL on the command line. Hit enter
Now you have your JCL ready. Just remove the output dataset’s DISP, UNIT and LABEL parameters. Replace those with the (NEW,CATLG,DELETE) and required SPACE, DCB parameters.
This would be useful if IDCAMS REPRO fails to copy the records correctly from indexed file into flat file. Sample job - VNDJ29.JCL(FILECOP)
