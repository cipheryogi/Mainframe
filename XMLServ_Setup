If XML services are installed along with ChangeMan you should be able to find a REXX member named XMLSERV in the CLIST or REXX library e.g. TEST.CHGMAN.V560.SYST.CLIST

 

The member contains following code which needs to be customized for your system environment in order to start using the online XML services (XMLSERV panel)

 

/* REXX XMLSERV */

  /*                                                                 */

  /* Customize the following for your site prior to use:             */

  /*   mapds:     XML mapdata dataset name.                          */

  /*   serparm:   ChangeMan STC ser#parm dataset name.               */

  /*   xmlinds:   User XML input dataset name in TSO dsn format.     */

  /*   xmloutds:  User XML output dataset name in TSO dsn format.    */

  /*   subsys:    Default ChangeMan subsystem id.                    */

  /*   sysout:    Sysout class                                       */

  /*   somnode:   Product library high level qualifier.              */

  /*                                                                 */

Following are the details on how to update this REXX code

 

In the MAPDS give the dataset name which ends with .MAPDATA. Search for your installation libraries. Meaning the libraries where you copied the vendor code (Serena provided code).

 

SERPARM should contain the TCPIP dataset. This last node for this dataset is usually TCPIPORT.

 

XMLINDS & XMLOUTDS can simply have "XMLIN" & "XMLOUT" respectively.

 

Put the single byte subsystem ID in the SUBSYS variable.

 

Leave SYSOUT, xamver, xmlver & test with default values

 

In the altlib, provide the CLIST library where XMLSERV member is residing. Concatenate CEXEC library with this

 

In the ispllib provide all the load libraries where you copied the vendor load modules. Also concatenate the SERCOM.LINKLIB & SERCOM.LIKLIBC

 

In the Ispmlib, provide all the libraries where you copied the vendor messages. Generally this should have node ISPMLIB.

 

In the ispplib, provide the SERCOM (vendor) panel library and concatenate the libraries where you copied any SERCOM panels. This is important. Usually the vendor library would have nodes SERCOM.ISPSLIB

 

Ispslib – Same as ispplib –important

 

No change required for rest of the REXX code.

 

Finally execute the XMLSERV by using line command EX or TSO command line – TSO EXEC ‘<PDS>(XMLSERV)’
